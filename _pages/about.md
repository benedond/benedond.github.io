Hello! I am Ond≈ôej Benedikt. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering](https://fel.cvut.cz/cz/), [CTU](https://www.cvut.cz/en) in Prague. Also, I work as a research assistant at [Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics](https://www.ciirc.cvut.cz/), CTU in Prague. 


## Studies & Work
I finished my bachelor's (2013-2016) and master's (2016-2017) studies at [Open Informatics](https://oi.fel.cvut.cz/), CTU in Prague, with a major in Artificial Intelligence. My primary study interests included general computer science, mathematics, algorithm design and complexity study, optimization, as well as AI and machine learning. After finishing my master's studies, I started a Ph.D. program with major interest in system modeling and optimization, and their synergy.

For a short summary of my working life, [see my CV](https://benedond.github.io/files/cv.pdf).


There are some things that I consider as my (work) **achievements**:
- I finished both my bachelor's and master's studies with an excellent average grade of 1.0 (equivalent to an A+ or 4.0 GPA), graduated with honors, and obtained Dean's award for my theses.
- Between 2020 and 2021, I have presented at three international conferences ([ICORES-2020](https://icores.scitevents.org/?y=2020), [CPAIOR-2020](https://cpaior2020.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/), and [RTCSA-2021](https://rtcsa2021.github.io/)), and at each of these conferences, my work was awarded either the *Best Student's Paper Award* or the *Best Paper Award*.
- (*in progress*) I plan to submit my dissertation thesis in the summer of 2022, which is about four years after I started my Ph.D. studies; I consider this a success since the average time at my department is nearing the seven years.
- Besides all these, the thing I value the most is that my colleagues come to me to discuss their problems and ask for advice. I am always happy to help, and I am glad that my opinion is important to them.

## Skills & Hobbies

I see myself as an analytical and rational person. I like thinking about problems and solving them. Particularly, I like **analyzing** and **formalizing** the problems, and **designing** the algorithms to solve them. A big part of the process is then the application of the **optimization** techniques to improve the solutions.

I am not a big programming enthusiast, but I see programming as a tool helping me achieve what is needed. As I usually only prototype the algorithms or write the scripts to prepare and process data, I prefer simple programming languages such as **Python**, which I use for most of my work. Recently, I have also started playing with **Julia**, which has a great potential to perform better than Python while being simple to use.

Sometimes, I also enjoy writing reports summarizing my work. I like thinking about the best way how to present the work and deliver the ideas. I also enjoy creating diagrams and other simple images, which are an essential part of the text and presentation. For the technical text, I am mostly using **LaTeX** language. For the graphs and images, I fancy **TikZ** and **Pgfplots**, which are powerful LaTeX packages.

During my free time, I am gradually renovating an old house nearby Prague. Thanks to that, I discovered some new hobbies, including masonry and plastering, woodworking, and gardening. When the time permits, I also enjoy reading books.
