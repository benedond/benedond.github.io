Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering](https://fel.cvut.cz/cz/), [CTU](https://www.cvut.cz/en) in Prague. Also, I work as a research assistant at [Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics](https://www.ciirc.cvut.cz/), CTU in Prague. 

At work, I deal with discrete optimization problems most of the times, especially (but not only) from the scheduling domain. As part of my Ph.D. studies and research I do many things, including problem analysis and formalization, complexity study, modeling, algorithm design, as well as design of the experiments, data collection, processing and visualization.

Studies
